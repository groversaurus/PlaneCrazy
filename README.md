# PlaneCrazy

A repository to build an application for handling ADS-B (Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast) data, while exploring and learning new architectural patterns.

## About

PlaneCrazy is an experimental project designed to process and visualize real-time aircraft tracking data using ADS-B technology. This project serves as both a practical application and a learning platform for implementing modern software architecture patterns and best practices.

## Purpose

- **ADS-B Data Processing**: Handle real-time aircraft position, velocity, and identification data
- **Architectural Learning**: Explore and implement modern architectural patterns such as:
  - Microservices architecture
  - Event-driven architecture
  - CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
  - Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
  - Clean Architecture principles
- **Technology Exploration**: Experiment with cutting-edge technologies and frameworks

## Features (Planned)

- Real-time ADS-B data ingestion and processing
- Aircraft tracking and position visualization
- Historical data storage and analysis
- RESTful API for data access
- Web-based dashboard for monitoring
- Scalable and maintainable architecture

## Technology Stack

This project is built using:

- **Primary Language**: C# / .NET
- **Development Environment**: Visual Studio / Visual Studio Code
- Additional technologies and frameworks will be added as the project evolves

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- .NET SDK (version TBD)
- Visual Studio 2022 or later (or Visual Studio Code with C# extension)
- Git for version control

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/groversaurus/PlaneCrazy.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd PlaneCrazy

# Further setup instructions will be added as the project develops
```

## About ADS-B

ADS-B (Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast) is a surveillance technology where aircraft determine their position via satellite navigation and periodically broadcast it, enabling them to be tracked. This technology is widely used in modern aviation for air traffic control and flight tracking services.

## Acknowledgments

- Inspired by the aviation community and open-source ADS-B projects
- Thanks to all contributors and supporters of this learning journey
